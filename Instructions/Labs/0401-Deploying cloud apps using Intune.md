## Exercise 1: Add a Microsoft Store App to Intune

### Scenario

You use Microsoft Intune to manage desktops and apps for Contoso Corporation. The Research department often connects to various servers to perform tasks and has asked for the Microsoft Remote Desktop app to be available for Research members to install as needed. The Microsoft Remote Desktop is available from the Microsoft Store, but you decide to add the app to Intune so that users can access it from the Company Portal website. A Research member named Aaron Nicholls has agreed to test the installation process after you have published the app to the portal.
