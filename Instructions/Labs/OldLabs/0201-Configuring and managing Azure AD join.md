# Practice Lab 0201: Configuring and managing Entra Join

## Summary

In this lab, you will configure Entra ID Join settings and perform both standard and Entra hybrid join scenarios for Windows devices.

### Prerequisites

To following lab(s) must be completed before this lab:

- 0102-Synchronizing Identities by using Microsoft Entra Connect

  > Note: You will also need a mobile phone that can receive text messages used to secure Windows Hello sign in authentication to Entra ID.

## Exercise 1: Configuring Entra Join

### Scenario

You need to configure Entra ID device settings to ensure that all users are allowed to join devices to Entra ID. You also need to ensure that users can only join a maximum of 20 devices and that Allan Deyoung is added as a local administrator on all Entra joined devices. Finally, you will verify that Entra join works as expected by having Joni Sherman join SEA-WS1 to the tenant.

### Task 1: Configure Entra join Device settings

1. On **SEA-SVR1**, if necessary, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd** and close Server Manager.

2. On the taskbar select **Microsoft Edge**, in the address bar type **https://entra.microsoft.com**, and then press **Enter**.

3. Sign in as user `Admin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`, and use the tenant Admin password. If the **Stay signed in?** prompt appears, select **No**. 

   > The Microsoft Entra admin center opens.

4. In the Microsoft Entra admin center, in the navigation pane, expand **Identity**.

5. Select **Devices** > **All devices**.

   > Notice that there are no devices found, as you have not joined any devices yet.

6. On the **Devices | All devices** page, select **Device settings**.

7. On the **Devices|Device settings** page, in the details pane, under **Users may join devices to Microsoft Entra**, verify that **All** is selected. 

   > This indicates that all Entra users are permitted to join Windows 10 or newer devices to Microsoft Entra. Note that this setting does not apply to Entra hybrid  joined devices, or devices joined by using Windows Autopilot self-deployment mode.

8. In the **Require Multi-factor Authentication to register or join devices with Microsoft Entra** section, verify that the setting is set to **No**. 

9. In the **Maximum number of devices per user** section, select **20**.

10. Under **Local administrator settings**, select **Manage Additional local administrators on all Entra joined devices**. The Device Administrators page opens.

11. In the Device Administrators page, select **Add assignments**.

12. In the Search box, enter **Allan Deyoung**, select the **Allan Deyoung** user object, and then select **Add**. 

    > Allan Deyoung will now be added as a Device Administrator on all Entra joined devices.

13. Scroll back to or select the **Devices | Device settings** navigation link at the top of the page.

14. On the Device settings page, select **Save**.

### Task 2: Perform an Entra Join

12. When the configuration is complete, select **Exit**.

13. Switch to **SEA-CL2**.

14. At the sign-in page, select the **Power** button and then select **Restart**.

    >**Note** Restarting **SEA-CL2** will enable quicker discovery of the SCP created by reconfiguring AAD Connect.

15. After **SEA-CL2** has restarted, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

### Task 3: Re-configure Azure AD Connect to sync the new OU

9. In the **Ready to configure** window, select **Configure** to run the configuration and start synchronization.

10. When the configuration is complete, select **Exit**.

    > **Note**: AAD Connect synchronizes automatically now when you modify the OUs being synced. You can use the **Synchronization Service** to monitor sync status.

### Task 4: Verify the Entra hybrid join

1. Switch to **SEA-CL2**.

2. Right-click **Start**, select **Shut down or sign out**, and then select **Restart**.

    _Note: The reboot will trigger the hybrid Azure AD join on SEA-CL2._
   
3. After **SEA-CL2** has restarted, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.
    
4. On the taskbar, right-click **Start** and select **Windows Terminal (Admin)**.

5. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
dsregcmd /status
```

6. In the output under **Device State**, verify that **AzureAdJoined : YES** and **DomainJoined : YES** are displayed.

   > **Note**: If the device is not yet joined to Azure AD, switch back to **SEA-SRV1** and run the command below. Once completed, switch back to SEA-CL2 and restart the computer once more.
   
```powershell
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
```

7. Close all windows on SEA-CL2 and sign out.

8. Switch to **SEA-SVR1** and switch to the Microsoft Entra admin center.

9. Expand **Identity**, and then select **Devices** > **All devices**. 

10. Verify that **SEA-CL2** has **Microsoft Entra hybrid joined** as value for the row **Join Type**. If necessary, select the **Refresh** button if SEA-CL2 is not listed.

11. Close all windows on **SEA-SVR1**.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully configured and validated Entra hybrid join.
