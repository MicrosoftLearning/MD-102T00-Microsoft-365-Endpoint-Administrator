## Summary

In this lab, you will use the Entra admin center to create and modify users, assign administrative roles, create and modify groups, and manage license assignments in Entra ID.

## Exercise 1: Creating users in Entra ID

### Scenario

You need to create user accounts in Azure AD for new employees that will start next week. New users are listed in the following table:

| Name           | User Name                             | Password   | Job title        | Department |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Edmund Reeve   | `ereeve@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`   | Pa55-w.rd! | HR Rep           | HR         |
| Miranda Snider | `msnider@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`  | Pa55-w.rd! | Helpdesk Manager | Operations |
| Cody Godinez   | `cgodinez@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com` | Pa55-w.rd! | Sales Rep        | Sales      |

_Note: For location use either your local region or United States._

You've also been told that several more employees will be hired over the next couple of months.
