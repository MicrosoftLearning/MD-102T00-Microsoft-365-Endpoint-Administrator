# Practice Lab 0501: Configuring Multi-factor Authentication

## Summary

In this lab, you will configure per-user multi-factor authentication (MFA) and apply MFA using a conditional access policy .

### Prerequisites

You will need a mobile phone that can receive text messages used to secure Windows Hello sign in authentication to Entra ID.

## Exercise 1: Configure per-user multi-factor authentication

### Scenario

To provide additional security for user sign on events, you need to configure and test multi-factor authentication (MFA). You decide to first test out per-user MFA. Alex Wilber has agreed to validate the settings for you. 

### Task 1: Validate sign-in before enabling MFA

1. Sign in to **SEA-WS3** as **Admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**. 

2. On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.
