# Practice Lab: Deploying Windows with Autopilot

## Summary

In this lab you will learn how provision a Windows 11 device with Autopilot using User-driven mode.

### Prerequisites

To following lab(s) must be completed before this lab:

- 0101-Managing Identities in Azure AD

- 0102-Synchronizing Identities by using Azure AD Connect

- 0701-Deploying Windows 11 using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit


### Scenario

Contoso IT is planning to roll out a deployment of new Windows 11 devices using Autopilot. The devices have a default installation of Windows 11. Users should be able to connect the device, turn it on, and answer minimal questions during the OOBE, using their Azure AD credentials to sign in. The process should automatically enroll and join the Azure AD domain. You have been asked to configure and test the experience using the SEA-WS4, which you recently installed and configured using Hyper-V.

> **Important**: We cannot use Windows 11 Hyper-V based virtual machines for Autopilot testing (Which we configured in the previous lab, 0701). This is due to a physical Trusted Platform Module (TPM) requirement. In this lab, we will test autopilot using Windows 10, however in the real world you can follow the same process for deploying windows 11 via Autopilot. for more details, see [Troubleshooting Windows Enrollment Issues](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/mem/intune/device-enrollment/troubleshoot-windows-enrollment-errors#securing-your-hardware-failed-0x800705b4).
