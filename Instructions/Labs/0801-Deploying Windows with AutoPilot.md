# Practice Lab 0801: Deploying Windows with Autopilot

## Summary

In this lab you will learn how provision a Windows 11 device with Autopilot using User-driven mode.

### Prerequisites

To following lab(s) must be completed before this lab:

- 0101-Managing Identities in Entra ID

- 0102-Synchronizing identities by using Entra Connect

### Scenario

Contoso IT is planning to roll out a deployment of new Windows 11 devices using Autopilot. The devices have a default installation of Windows 11. Users should be able to connect the device, turn it on, and answer minimal questions during the OOBE, using their Entra ID credentials to sign in. The process should automatically enroll and join the Entra ID domain. You have been asked to configure and test the experience.

### Task 1: Create group in Entra ID

1. Sign in to **SEA-SVR1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd** and close **Server Manager**.

2. On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

3. In Microsoft Edge, in the address bar, type **https://entra.microsoft.com**, and then press **Enter**. If prompted, sign in with your **`Admin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`** and the default tenant password.

4. In the navigation pane, Expand **Entra ID**.

5. Select **Groups** and then select **All groups**.

    (device.devicePhysicalIDs -any (_ -startsWith "[ZTDid]"))
    ```
    
14. Select **Save** to close **Dynamic membership rules**, and then select **Create** to create the group.

### Task 2: Generate a device-specific comma-separated value (CSV) file
