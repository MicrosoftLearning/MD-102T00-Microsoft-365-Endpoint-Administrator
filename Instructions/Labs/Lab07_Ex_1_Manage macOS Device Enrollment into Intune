# Practice Lab07: Manage macOS Devices

## Summary

In this lab, you use Microsoft Intune to create a device restriction profile and an update policy for macOS devices.

### Prerequisites

To complete all tasks successfully, an Apple account is necessary. This account is crucial for creating an Apple MDM push certificate. The Apple Push Certificate serves as a digital handshake between Intune and Apple devices, establishing a secure and trusted connection for transmitting commands, policies, and updates. Without this certificate, Intune cannot manage macOS devices. 

The instructions below are only intended to simulate a real-life scenario for training purposes and assume that a valid Apple account already exists. Students are not required to create an Apple account or a certificate in the Apple Push Certificates Portal. If users choose to create an Apple account, they are solely responsible for ensuring that their actions comply with Apple's applicable terms and conditions, including but not limited to the Apple MDM Certificate Agreement. The authors of this guide assume no responsibility for the creation or use of Apple accounts outside of these terms.

This section describes how to create an enrollment program token in Intune. The enrollment program token (sometimes referred to as an automated device enrollment token) is a necessary component of automated device enrollment. It enables the communication and device management capabilities between Intune and your chosen Apple enrollment program. It allows Intune to sync information from your Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager account, and apply profiles to devices.
